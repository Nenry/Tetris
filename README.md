## Background and Overview
Tetris is a tile matching game with randomly generated tile sizes. Players are given one tile at a time and they must keep stacking the tiles. If the tiles stack as high as the column then it is game over. If a row is completely filled with tiles then that row will clear. Scores will be given for clearing rows and score multplier if multiple rows are cleared. 


## Functionality & MVP
In Tetris, users will be able to:
- [ ] Rotate tile pieces of custom sizes with colors
- [ ] Drop the tile piece quickly to the bottom
- [ ] Start, pause, restart, and reset the simulation
- [ ] View instructions
- [ ] See the player's current score


## Wireframes
This app will consist of a single screen that will utilize canvas, and nav links to the Github, my Linkedin.

Users will be able see their current score on the right and play tetris on the left. In addition, there will be Start, Pause, Restart, Reset, and Mute buttons as well.
